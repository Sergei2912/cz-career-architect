Choose people who will speak highly of you You’ll want to consider who your references will be early on in the job search process, as references can be asked for as early as the application phase. Make a list of people who could be potential references. Consider individuals who you believe will speak highly of your accomplishments, work ethic, character and qualifications. References can be any of the following:- Former managers or supervisors - Former employees - Former coworkers - Industry colleagues - Advisors, teachers, mentors or instructors - Connections from volunteering, professional clubs or academic groups 2. Get approval before you list a reference Once you’ve decided on references, ask them for their approval before you list them. You want to avoid a situation where your reference is contacted without knowing you’ve listed them. This could hinder the quality of their reference and may even put the opportunity at risk. The person giving you a reference may be required to write a letter, fill out a questionnaire, or speak to someone from human resources on the phone. Providing this favor is no small task. It can be helpful to give your potential reference plenty of time to consider the request, and thank them for their time. Related: Types of References and How To Get Them3. Ask politely and be aware of how you’re being received If it’s been a while since you’ve communicated with a potential reference, it may be helpful to connect the dots between the past and the present, including what you worked on together and where you are in your current career path. Providing your resume is an easy way to do this. It's advisable to always give your potential reference an option to decline by using language like, “Would you feel comfortable being a reference for me?” or, “I understand your time is valuable, so don’t hesitate to let me know if this isn’t a good time.” If they show any hesitation, gracefully back out of the invitation and move down your list to the next option. It’s better to preserve the relationship in the long run.Related: What To Do When You've Received a Bad Reference4. Provide them with helpful details Once you’ve provided your list of references to your potential employer, you can send a quick email to let each reference know which company will be reaching out and, if you know the details, what information the company will be requesting. You can provide your references with a brief overview of what the role is and any specific information you’d like them to speak to, as this will make it easier for your reference to know what to say.Here’s an example email for how to update your references: Subject line: Reference request – updateDear [Reference’s name],Thank you again for being a reference for me. I wanted to let you know that I’ve completed my interviews for the [job title you interviewed for], and ABC Company may be contacting you soon.

Follow up with a thank you Follow up with your reference to thank them after every reference they provide. You can do so through a handwritten letter or a thoughtful email. Then, if you are hired for the position, you can take a moment to celebrate by sending a quick email to your references to let them know you’ve accepted a position and that you’re grateful for their help on your behalf. You might consider letting your reference know that you’re willing to return the favor if ever required.Here’s an example email for how to thank your reference:Subject line: Reference request – Thank you!Dear [Reference’s name],I’ve just accepted the [job you interviewed for] role at ABC Company.
