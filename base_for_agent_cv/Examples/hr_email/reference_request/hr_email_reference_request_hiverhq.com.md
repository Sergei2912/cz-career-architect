If you are not sure who to ask for references, here are a few tips:
Think about your previous employers. Who were your direct supervisors? Who were the people you worked with closely? These are the people who are most likely to be able to speak to your work experience and performance.
Consider your colleagues. Did you work on any projects with other people? Did you have any mentors or coaches? These people can also provide valuable insights into your work and abilities.
Ask your friends and family. If you don’t have any professional references, you can ask your friends and family for a personal reference. They may be able to provide references that speak to your character and personality.
Once you have chosen your references, it is important to ask them for permission before you list them on your resume or application.
