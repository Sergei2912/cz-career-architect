Request a reference for a new employee or candidate
You’ve gone through the interview process, and
asked the candidate for their references
— now it’s time to get in touch with those references so you can seal the deal. 💥
Speaking with a candidate’s reference is a common practice that helps you get an even deeper understanding of an individual’s background, skillset and past behavior in a role. It’s useful for businesses new to recruitment or for roles that specifically require reference checks. Sometimes, a strong reference is all you need to know to send that super sweet
job offer letter
.
Here’s a reference email template for you to use and customize when
connecting with a candidate’s references.
