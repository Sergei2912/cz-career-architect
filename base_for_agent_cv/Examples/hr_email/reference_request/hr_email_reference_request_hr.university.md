Sincerely, Signature (hard copy letter) [name] However, if you do not feel that you can genuinely endorse or vouch for this person for the specific position or if your company does not support providing references, you should politely refuse their request for a reference. It is fairer not to write a recommendation than to write one expressing anything less than complete confidence in the employee for a new job. These six recommendation letter templates can help you stand out in front of hiring managers. Conclusively, a compelling letter contains relevant examples, one or two sentences on your ability to handle tasks, your satisfied customers, leadership skills, how you establish productive relationships in the workplace, and your interpersonal skills. What is Included in a Letter of Recommendation? 1. Specific Details When a previous employee asks you to write a reference letter for them, they should provide you with elaborate details so you can write a well-rounded letter of recommendation. If they have not worked for you for a while, they should provide you with a newer copy of their CV so that you have the updated dates and when they worked for you and can see what additional skills they have added since then. A job posting or description for the position they are applying for is also helpful. They should also let you know if they have the hiring manager’s name. 2. Follow the Correct Format Send your letter in a business format. You will start with your details, such as contact information, followed by the present-day date and then the hiring manager’s details, such as contact information. Your greeting should be followed by the letter’s body paragraph, where you will begin by stating how long you have known the candidate and in what capacity. You can then detail their skills, experiences, and strengths, which make them exceptional employees. In addition, it can be helpful to use specific achievements and anecdotes to emphasize the qualities most relevant to the position they seek. In your conclusion, mention your utmost confidence in your candidate and offer your strong recommendation for them for the role. Thank the hiring manager for their valuable time. Let them know you are available to answer any further questions or clarification. If you send an email, your personal contact information should follow your name and not be in the heading. A breakdown of the format is as follows: The greeting and heading should have your information and a greeting or introduction. Heading The heading should include your contact details, title or school name, date, address, and city. Salutation If you are writing a letter of reference, include a salutation such as (Dear Mr., Dear Dr., etc.). If you write a general letter, use “To Whom It May Concern,” or don’t include a salutation. Start your note with the first paragraph if you don’t have a greeting. The body is where you describe the individual’s relevant skills, explain why you’re a good reference, and why the individual is qualified. Body Paragraph A strong letter has a body paragraph containing three paragraphs. These include further information about the job seeker, which a potential employer wants to know. Writing a recommendation letter requires telling an employer about the prospective employee’s conduct, how they behave around other employees, and how they are a valuable asset to the next company. First Paragraph The number one paragraph of a recommendation letter explains your connection to the person you recommend, why you are qualified to advise the person for employment or school (school counselor), and how you know them. Second Paragraph The number two paragraph of a recommendation letter elaborates on the information about the individual you are writing about, what they can contribute, why you recommend them, and why they are qualified for a position. If needed, use multiple paragraphs to provide details. [Name] graduated with honors in [specific major] and was always focused on how his future would progress. He knew he wanted to pursue a [career name] early on and worked as a research assistant, independently and in groups. I believe that [name] would be an asset to your department, as is an incredibly qualified and bright individual who is a pleasure to work with. He brings a tremendous amount of enthusiasm and energy to his studies. Third Paragraph When writing the third paragraph, ensure that the recommendation letter includes information on how the person’s skills align with the position they are applying for. Ask for a copy of the person’s resume and a copy of the job posting so you can target your letter accordingly. I believe [name] would be an excellent addition to your international [department] team. When I worked with her previously at XYZ, I was awed by her ability to close a sale by communicating the effectiveness of our products to our clients. During my years with her, she added several new clients in [country names]. Summary This section of the recommendation letter summarizes why you are recommending the person. Use phrases like “strongly recommend,” “recommend without reservation,” or “candidate has my highest recommendation” to reinforce your endorsement. During my acquaintance with Joanne, she has been efficient, professional, organized, and a fantastic team leader. As a result, she has my highest recommendation for the office manager position at DEF, Inc. Conclusion The last paragraph of your recommendation letter consists of an offer to provide more information. Include a number within the paragraph, your email address in the return address section of your letter, or under your signature, and give the phone number again. Truly, signature (hard copy letter) Name of the recommender Title Email Address Phone Number Send an Email if Appropriate Occasionally, an employee will ask you for an email reference, especially if they are on a time crunch. In this case, follow the business letter format after omitting the address paragraphs. Your subject should contain the individual’s name, details on how this is a reference, and the job title of the role they are applying for, for example, “Subject: [name]—Reference for .” FAQs Here are the most frequently asked questions about letters of recommendation. What are the submission instructions for a letter of recommendation? Submission instructions vary depending on the organization or institution. Typically, letters of recommendation are submitted electronically through an online portal or email. Some systems may require the recommender to upload the letter directly, ensuring confidentiality. Reviewing the specific submission guidelines provided during the application process is important to avoid delays or errors. How does a letter of recommendation fit into the application process? A letter of recommendation is a crucial component of many application processes. It provides insight into the applicant’s skills, character, and qualifications from a third-party perspective. It is often required for job applications, academic programs, scholarships, or internships. The recommendation adds credibility and context to an applicant’s profile, enhancing their chances of being selected. Is there a recommendation template I can provide to my recommender? Many institutions or organizations provide a recommendation template to guide recommenders in crafting their letters. If no template is provided, you can share a general structure, including sections for the recommender’s introduction, their relationship to the applicant, specific examples of the applicant’s abilities, and a conclusion summarizing their endorsement. Providing a template ensures consistency and makes it easier for the recommender to address key points effectively. Are there common mistakes to avoid when handling letters of recommendation? Yes, some common mistakes include failing to follow the submission instructions, providing outdated or irrelevant recommendation templates, and not allowing sufficient time for the recommender to write the letter. Applicants should also ensure the recommender has all the necessary details about the application process, including deadlines and specific points to address.
